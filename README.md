# 6things - Your Social Notebook
## 6things has 2 primary use cases: personal understanding and seamless collaboration.
### Use case 1: Personal Understanding
You should not be on your own when learning something new, but your notes should be your own. 6things allows people to build their personal understandings "off the shoulders of giants." 
- Pull items from other notebooks into your own notebook.
  - Receive updates when pulled items are modified by their authors
- Follow other notebooks for the latest information and inspiration
### Use case 2: Seamless Collaboration
Current methods of collaboration allow members to override the contributions of others. With 6things, you are the sole author of your own item, and notebooks can consist of the items of multiple collaborators.
- Comment on other collaborators' items
- Items are very small segments of information, ensuring close collaboration
